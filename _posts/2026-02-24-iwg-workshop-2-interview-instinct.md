How do you prepare international graduate students for AI-integrated interviews — while honoring different communication instincts?

That question shaped **IWG Workshop #2**, where I designed an interactive assessment tool and storytelling framework to help students discover and leverage their natural interview strengths.

## The Challenge

AI collaboration is becoming a standard part of consulting interviews (McKinsey's Lilli, BCG's GAMMA). International students face a double barrier: unfamiliar interview formats AND cultural differences in self-presentation.

Generic "practice your STAR stories" advice doesn't account for the fact that **people think, communicate, and problem-solve differently** — and those differences are strengths, not weaknesses.

## The Solution: Interview Instinct + HIVE

I designed a two-part system:

### 1. Interview Instinct Assessment

A 24-question interactive quiz that maps students to one of 8 "interview animals" across three behavioral axes:

- **Heart vs Mastery** — what drives you?
- **Cozy vs Open** — how do you work?
- **Craft vs Fusion** — how do you think?

Each animal comes with a personalized interview superpower, storytelling prompt, and actionable strengths.

### 2. HIVE Storytelling Framework

A replacement for STAR that better captures the narrative arc interviewers actually remember:

| | |
|---|---|
| **H** — Habitat | Set the scene. Where were you? |
| **I** — Initiative | What did you decide to do? |
| **V** — Venture | What happened when you tried? |
| **E** — Effect | What changed because of you? |

## Design Principles

The workshop structure follows evidence-based intervention design:

- **Belonging uncertainty reduction** (Walton & Cohen) — the ice-breaker creates instant community through shared animal identities
- **Growth mindset framing** (Yeager) — reframing interview anxiety as a skill-building opportunity
- **Self-relevance** (Falk) — personalized prompts matched to each student's communication instinct
- **Embodied practice** — 60-second storytelling with real-time peer feedback

## The Red Envelope Moment

The workshop's signature activity: each student receives a red envelope (a Lunar New Year tradition) containing their personalized HIVE story prompt. The cultural gesture creates emotional resonance; the personalized prompt creates immediate relevance.

> Your animal IS your storytelling voice. The prompt in your red envelope is designed for YOUR instinct.

## What I Learned

Designing personality-driven workshop tools taught me that **effective interventions need to meet people where they are** — not where a generic framework assumes they should be. The same interview question lands differently for someone whose instinct is precision (Owl) versus connection (Bunny).

This reinforces my broader research interest: how do we design health and behavioral messages that work *with* people's existing cognitive and cultural patterns?
