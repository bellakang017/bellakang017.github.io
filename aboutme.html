<div class="aboutme">
  <p>I study why health messages reach some people and miss others — and what culturally embedded beliefs have to do with that gap.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>🔬 What I Do</h3>
  <p>I research how communication patterns — especially self-silencing and help-seeking — shape health outcomes among immigrant women. My current focus is on Korean American midlife women: how culturally specific communication styles interact with stress, coping, and access to care.</p>

  <h3>🎓 Where I Sit</h3>
  <p>MA Advertising (Thesis Track), Moody College of Communication, UT Austin<br>
  <em>Research areas: health communication · behavioral science · intervention design</em></p>

  <h3>💡 How I Think About Interventions</h3>
  <p>Small shifts in how people interpret their circumstances can redirect self-defeating patterns into self-enhancing ones. I follow a full-cycle model: field observation → theory → experimentation → back to the field.</p>
  <blockquote>How do we design messages that work <em>with</em> (not against) the cognitive and cultural contexts people actually inhabit?</blockquote>
